	 * It's extremely difficult to turn metrics on and off, as you have to
	 * manually add the code in the try>/finally block to each and every method
	 * or constructor you want to benchmark. The profiling code really doesn't
	 * belong sprinkled throughout your application code. It makes your code
	 * bloated and harder to read, as you have to enclose the timings within a
	 * try/finally block. If you wanted to expand this functionality to include
	 * a method or failure count, or even to register these statistics to a more
	 * sophisticated reporting mechanism, you'd have to modify a lot of
	 * different files (again).
