package com.creationa.builder.pattern;
//The builder pattern, as name implies, is an alternative way to construct complex objects.
//This should be used only when you want to build different immutable objects using same object building process.
//Before starting the discussion, I want to make it clear that the builder pattern which I am going to discuss in this post, 
//is slightly different from what is mentioned in GangOfFour “Design Patterns” book. The book says:
//Builder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.”
//Here, builder pattern will help you to consume additional attributes while retaining the 
//immutability of Use class.
